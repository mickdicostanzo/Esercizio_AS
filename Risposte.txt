1. How many topics are in the bag?
	There are a total of 5 topics. 
2. Determine the Hz of the topic image
	It'something close to 29.27 Hz
3. Determine the Hz of the topic system
	It's something like 1.79 Hz
4. Determine what does the topic system return.
	The Topic system returns a Sysmon message. It stores information about system's state
5. Create a workspace in ROS2:
	First of all I used the command: source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
	Then I created the directory ros2_ws with: mkdir -p ros_ws
	After that I created the package esercizio (so imaginative) with: ros2 pkg create --build-type ament_cmake --license Apache-2.0 esercizio
	Then I made the build with: colcon build
	After putting the interface and bag's file in the workspace i rebuild everything

In order to answer the first 4 questions I used the command ros2 bag info. With this command I could get all the information about the topics
